On Windows, Git Bash provided with [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org) is recommended.

## Usage

<<<<<<< HEAD
`squash-branch [base-branch] "commit-message"`

If `base-branch` is not provided, `master` is used.

### Examples

To squash the current branch into one commit using `master` (default) as base branch:

```bash
squash-branch "My squashed commit"
```

To squash the current branch into one commit using `my-base-branch` as base branch:

```bash
squash-branch my-base-branch "My squashed commit"
```

To squash a the current branch using a multi-line commit message:

```bash
$ squash-branch "My squashed commit header
=======
`squash-branch [base-branch] [squash-branch] "commit-message"`

- If `base-branch` is not provided, `master` is used.
- If `squash-branch` is not provided, the current branch is used.
- If only providing one branch argument, the `squash-branch` is set and `base-branch` defaults to `master`.
- The `squash-branch` is always checked out before squashing it.

### Examples

```bash
# Squash current branch (default) using 'master' (default) as base branch
squash-branch "My squashed commit"

# Squash branch 'my-branch' using 'master' (default) as base branch
squash-branch my-branch "My squashed commit"   

# Squash branch 'my-branch' using 'my-base-branch' as base branch
squash-branch my-base-branch my-branch "My squashed commit"

# Squash a branch using a multi-line commit message
squash-branch "My squashed commit header
>>>>>>> cb5950ff2d9cddb6f6b0b6aeb1e1d533d45fd4ef
> and some info on the second line
> and some info on the third line"
```

## Install

on your path.
